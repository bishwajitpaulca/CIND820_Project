Retail Data Forecasting

Questions:

Predict the department-wide sales for each store for the following year
Model the effects of markdowns on holiday weeks
Provide recommended actions based on the insights drawn, with prioritization placed on the largest business impact

Context: The Challenge - One challenge of modeling retail data is making decisions based on 
limited history. Holidays and select major events come once a year, and so does the chance to see how strategic decisions
impact the bottom line. In addition, markdowns are known to affect sales â€“ the challenge is to predict which departments 
will be affected and to what extent.
